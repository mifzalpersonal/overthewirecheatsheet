how?

well well well

first of all

ltrace ./check

and then just put what it says there, its sex. trust me

and then boom you're kinda? kinda on another level of users? now u can cat the /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2

that is crazy yet simple and i still didnt know what that shit is

leviathan1@leviathan:~$ ltrace ./check
__libc_start_main(0x80490ed, 1, 0xffffd464, 0 <unfinished ...>
printf("password: ")                                         = 10
getchar(0, 0, 0x786573, 0x646f67password: sex
)                            = 115
getchar(0, 115, 0x786573, 0x646f67)                          = 101
getchar(0, 0x6573, 0x786573, 0x646f67)                       = 120
strcmp("sex", "sex")                                         = 0
geteuid()                                                    = 12001
geteuid()                                                    = 12001
setreuid(12001, 12001)                                       = 0
system("/bin/sh"$
$
$ ls
check
$ ./check
password: sex?
$ oh
/bin/sh: 1: oh: Permission denied
$ cd ..
$ ls
